Mikey was a frog. He was a friendly frog, however Mikey was completely hideous.
So much so that he found it impossible to make any friends. One day, Mikey was 
sitting by the edge of his favorite pond when a small trout visited him at the
bank. Mikey got in the water to say hello to the trout, and was pleasantly 
surprised when the trout did not swim away! The trout introduced himself as Jimmy, 
and after a thorough conversation, they discovered they both shared a passion for
Competitive Underwater Knitting!
